# Mulch

Mulch is a Gulp-based frontend boilerplate that features Twig, LESS/SASS, and BrowserSync. It's a great starting point for frontend projects that run on PHP backends that use Twig. (Craft CMS, Drupal 8, Symfony, HiFi, etc).

It is currently in a very early state and needs help so that it can be cleaned up and made more useful.
